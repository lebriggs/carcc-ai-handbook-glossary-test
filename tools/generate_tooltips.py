"""Generates tooltip entries from the full glossary.

The glossary terms are stored as ### headings in glossary.md.
For each glossary entry, this script takes the first sentence of the definition
and writes it in the format expected by the abbr Markdown extension.

Extra approved term variants can be listed in variant_terms.txt.
Each variant uses the same tooltip definition as its glossary term.

Terms listed in this file are matched wherever they appear in the handbook.
By default, only the first occurrence of each glossary entry on a page is highlighted.
Terms are not highlighted in headings, table header cells, existing links, or on the full glossary page.

Definitions appear as tooltips on hover on desktop.
Format: *[term]: definition
Case variants each need their own line.
Plural variants each need their own line.

The tooltip definition must match the beginning of the full definition in glossary.md.
