# Model Benchmarking, Quality Control, and Optimization

## Definition

**Model Benchmarking** (**MB**): evaluating AI models on well-defined tasks
using specified datasets, metrics, protocols, and hardware, to assess a model's
quality (e.g., accuracy), efficiency (e.g., latency, throughput, cost),
scalability, and robustness (reliability, bias).

**Quality Control** (**QC**): testing, auditing, and ongoing monitoring for
errors, biases, and inefficiencies relative to acceptance criteria for
performance, reliability, and/or ethical standards.

**Model Optimization** (**MO**): iterative process to improve an AI model's
performance, efficiency, and scalability for deployment while balancing accuracy
and costs.

## Examples of Specific Tasks

* **Benchmarking**: for a new medical AI model that was finetuned based on a
  BERT model, evaluate its performance on Named Entity Recognition (NER) for
  clinical notes. Run benchmarks to compare its performance against
  [BioBERT](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/4/1234/5566506)
  or [ClinicalBERT](https://huggingface.co/medicalai/ClinicalBERT) using the
  same test dataset (e.g. the i2b2 benchmark dataset). Evaluate precision,
  recall, F1-score, inference latency, and throughput using identical hardware
  and software configurations.
* **Quality control**: The new model needs to be assessed for its robustness and
  trustworthiness. For the above medical AI model, add noise to the data input
  (e.g. spelling errors, irrelevant text) to test the model's robustness on
  medical NER tasks. If the precision is much lower with the noise, then the
  model is fragile. Run the model with the same prompt many times to see if it
  produces contradictory answers. Compare error rates across demographic groups
  to detect biases.
* **Optimization**: for issues identified in benchmarking and quality control,
  various optimizations can be applied to improve model's performance. For
  example, if the new model's domain performance is poor, e.g. low F-1 score or
  precision, the model needs further domain-adaptive fine tuning by increasing
  domain specific data sets or data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning using
  Optuna or Ray Tune tools. To optimize the latency and scalability, identify
  the bottlenecks and reduce the latency and operating cost by applying model
  quantization, optimizing batch sizes and data pipelines, adopting parallel and
  distributed computing for better throughput and resource utilization.
